# Emotion-recognition-using-CNN


###Project Description: Facial Expression Recognition System
###This project aims to develop a deep learning model to automatically recognize facial expressions in images. The model will be able to classify human faces into seven different emotional categories: neutral, ###anger, disgust, fear, happy, sad, and surprise.

Project Goals:
Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of accurately classifying facial expressions in grayscale images.
Achieve high accuracy on a standard facial expression recognition dataset.
Project Scope:
The project focuses on recognizing emotions from static images, not videos.
The model is trained on a pre-existing facial expression dataset.
Seven emotional categories are considered for classification.
Methodology:
Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

Load a dataset of grayscale facial expression images labeled with their corresponding emotions.
Preprocess the images by resizing them to a uniform size and converting them to grayscale if necessary.
Model Building:

Design a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Use techniques like Batch Normalization and Dropout to prevent overfitting.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
Train the CNN model on the training set using an optimizer like Adam and a categorical cross-entropy loss function.
Monitor the model's performance on the validation set to prevent overfitting.
Implement techniques like early stopping and learning rate reduction to optimize training.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model's performance on the validation set using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
Plot training and validation accuracy and loss curves to visualize the learning process.
Model Saving:

Save the trained model for future use.
Deliverables:
A trained CNN model capable of classifying facial expressions.
Evaluation results including accuracy and confusion matrix.
Plots visualizing the training and validation performance.
Potential Applications:
This facial expression recognition system could be used in various applications such as:
Human-computer interaction systems that respond to user emotions.
Market research to analyze customer sentiment based on facial expressions.
Robotics to enable robots to better understand human emotions.
Educational technology to provide personalized feedback based on student engagement.
